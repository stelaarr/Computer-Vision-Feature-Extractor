# Computer-Vision-Feature-Extractor

Processing of image data using ImageIO and OpenCV.
Processing of face features using Py-Feat.
In this assignment, you will process and analyse a small dataset consisting of stock photos. You will create visualizations, process face features, and analyse which features are most likely to be important in order to predict an emotional state.

Scripts focusing on processing image data using ImageIO and OpenCV, and processing face features using Py-Feat. 

### Tools and Libraries Used
- ImageIO: For reading and writing image files in various formats.
- OpenCV: A powerful computer vision library for image processing.
- Py-Feat: A library for extracting face features such as facial landmarks and expressions.
- Matplotlib: For creating visualizations of the data.
